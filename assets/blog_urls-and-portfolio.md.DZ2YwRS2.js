I&#39;m excited to share my experience working with Deno and VitePress on two recent projects.

I chose it for several reasons:</p><ul><li>Built-in TypeScript support</li><li>Robust security features</li><li>Developer-friendly tools (Deno FMT and Deno Lint)</li><li>Clean dependency management</li></ul><p>I faced some challenges deploying it live, especially with CORS errors, but I eventually figured it out. While I didn&#39;t need to deploy it live for the take-home project with a company I was interviewing with at the time, I wanted to challenge myself and learn more about deployment processes. Eventually I was able to deploy it live and it&#39;s working great!
