:::

I built this project to streamline AI model deployment and interaction, offering a Docker-based setup for Ollama with Open WebUI. It supports GPU acceleration, robust security measures like memory limits and read-only filesystems, and operates locally, making it ideal for securely managing and interacting with the latest large language models like DeepSeek and Qwen. Models can be accessed through Open WebUI's modern UI on port 3000 or directly via port 11434 for API interactions.
